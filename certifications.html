		<p>These programs are all led by venerable fitness institutions, combining cutting-edge fitness science and methodologies with the convenience of distance learning. Additionally, many include professional guidance, internship placements, and other assistance to get you out of the classroom quickly—and into your first fitness training position. Here’s a closer look at some of the best personal trainer certifications available today.</p>
		<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/1KMsaUi_iWEIAb_5M27QpvIt1UHJ55YPcMppZnoF4WhsYm6OazrTBQihtR0CbJZoe-N_0qAuPQWQ2xu7-KBwbGPi3NiDdwiiCIcDS-o8p1UITQ6sank1fODwvCdSlIDm92nzNEKt" alt="" width="624" height="416"></p>
		<h2><strong>#1. International Sports Sciences Association (ISSA)</strong></h2>
		<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://issa.sjv.io/9Wd7W3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">International Sports Sciences Association</a> is another option, particularly for those students who require distance education. The ISSA bills itself as “the trainer’s trainer,” offering a huge variety of self-paced distance courses on many different fitness and health-related topics. They even have an Associate’s Degree program in Exercise Science, for those interested in improving their knowledge.</p>
		<p>The Personal Trainer Certificate, while not an undergraduate degree, nonetheless provides fitness instructors and trainers with the skills they need to provide comprehensive fitness training.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<ul>
		<li>

ISSA’s personal trainer certification is built around the philosophical and scientific aspects of fitness—anatomy, health assessment, and movement principles—with an eye toward applying those skills in a practical, day-to-day environment. Therefore, the curriculum also includes sections on business management and marketing, as well as tailoring programs to meet clients' diverse requirements and needs. Coursework is self-paced and students receive a dedicated student success coach to help them whenever needed.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>Prerequisites and Eligibility Requirements. The self-paced curriculum is divided into practice quizzes, which will not affect your overall score. However, completion of all quizzes is required. Candidates must be 18 years of age but do not need a high school diploma or equivalent. Students are required to have a valid CPR/AED/First Aid Certification, which can be purchased online through ISSA.</p>
		</li>
